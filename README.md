## Model Overview:
For this challenge, we primarily utilized a **Vision Transformer** model, specifically the **InternVL 1B**. Our approach focused on leveraging the model's powerful image understanding capabilities and applying the following additional techniques to enhance performance:
- **Post-processing methods** to refine model predictions.
- **Image upscaling and cropping** to improve input quality and align model outputs with the competition requirements.

## Instructions to Use:
To reproduce the results or experiment with the model, please follow the steps provided in the [`Submission.ipynb`](Submission.ipynb) notebook. The notebook contains detailed instructions for replicating the result in Google Colab.

Make sure to have all required packages installed before running the notebook. You can find a list of dependencies inside the notebook itself.
